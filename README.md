## 📝 Overview

**SMDB\_JAVA\_build** is a simple, straightforward **Student Information Database Management System** developed using Java. This application allows users to store, retrieve, update, and manage student records efficiently through a clean, easy-to-use interface.

It is designed as a foundational project for demonstrating basic database connectivity and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Java.

## ✨ Features

The system is intended to provide core functionalities for managing a student database:

* **Add New Students:** Quickly input and save new student records (e.g., name, roll number, course, contact info).
* **View All Students:** Retrieve and display a list of all students currently in the database.
* **Search/Retrieve:** Find specific student records using key identifiers like a Roll Number.
* **Update Information:** Modify existing student details (e.g., correcting a phone number).
* **Delete Records:** Permanently remove a student's record from the database.
